	<h2>Are you sure that all of the antibiotics you take necessary? </h2>
	<p class="class">A lot of us take antibiotics when we're not feeling good, not doubting it's help. <br> It's one of the things that we do without questionning, something we're used to.</p>

	<div align="center">

	<p id="id">Researches showed that a not-so-small amount of the antibiotics we take are unnecessary/ don't help as much as it's supposed to. <br> So is it really helping? If it's not, why do people make us think that they do and what's their agenda??</p>
